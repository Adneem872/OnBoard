# YOUR PROJECT 
I have just made a PCB hacker card â€” a sleek, compact NFC-enabled circuit board designed to interact with and emulate NFC devices. 

The total cost is approximately $40

During the design process, one of the key challenges was routing traces efficiently on a small form factor while ensuring reliable NFC antenna performance. Iterative testing and community resources helped refine the layout and minimize interference for optimal scanning distance.
